  * Generalist Social Work Practice provides students with the foundational skills and knowledge needed to serve clients across micro, mezzo and macro areas of practice. Author Janice Gasker brings a focus on self-reflection as the first stage in the planned change process and writes with the perspective that we consider work at all levels of practice simultaneously rather than in isolation. In accordance with the 2015 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) set forth by the Council of Social Work Education (CSWE), the planned change process is presented as dynamic and interactive, providing students with a clear understanding of how each stage of the planned change process can be utilized at any point when serving a client system. The text spotlights the distinctive characteristics of the worker―their values, attitudes, and experiences―that may influence client interaction. The text also includes case studies, collaborative learning exercises, and critical thinking questions to help students apply concepts to practice.
